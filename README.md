AsydSolutions/monit
===================

This is a fork from the official [Monit repository](https://bitbucket.org/tildeslash/monit) including some small changes for getting more detailed output from the XML web API to use on ASYD (i.e. host failure notifications).

The ASYD builds are based on the latest stable Monit version (currently 5.10) with the mentioned patch. You can see all the [differences](https://github.com/AsydSolutions/monit/compare/release-5-10-0...asyd) between the official 5.10 and ASYD's version.

[![Monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/img/logo@2x.png)](http://mmonit.com/monit) 
 

#[Monit](http://mmonit.com/monit) is a free open source utility for managing and monitoring, processes, programs, files, directories and filesystems on a UNIX system. Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations.#

---

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

__Memory and Disk space__. A minimum of 1 megabytes RAM are required and around 500KB of free disk space. You may need more RAM depending on how many services Monit should monitor. 
  
__ANSI-C Compiler and Build System__. You will need an ANSI-C99 compiler installed to build Monit. The GNU C compiler (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended. In addition, your PATH must contain basic build tools such as make.

BOOTSTRAPPING
=============

If you build Monit from the git repository, you need to call `./bootstrap` first before continuing with the installation steps below. To build a Monit release package from a bootstrapped build directory, perform the following steps. 1. `make cleanall` 2. `./bootstrap && ./configure` 3. `make dist` This will create a self-contained `monit-x.y.z.tar.gz` package which can be distributed. 


INSTALLATION
============

Monit utilize the GNU auto-tools and provided the requirements above are
satisfied, building Monit is conducted via the standard;  

> ./configure  
> make  
> make install  

This will install Monit and the Monit man-file in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man/man1 respectively. If you want another location than
/usr/local, run configure with the *--prefix* options and specify the install directory. 

Use ./configure --help for build and install options. By default, Monit is built with SSL, PAM and large file support. You can change this
with the *--without-<xxx>* options to ./configure. For instance, *--without-ssl*, *--without-pam* or *--without-largefiles*.


QUICK START
===========

After you have built Monit you can simply start the monit program from the build directory to test it. Monit will use the `monitrc` control file
located in this directory for it's configuration. The file is setup to start Monit's http server so you have something interesting to look at;
After you have started monit, point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2812/` and log in with the username `admin` and password `monit`.

Once started, monit will run as a background process. To stop monit, use `monit quit`. To run monit in the foreground and in diagnostic mode,
start monit with the -Iv options. In diagnostic mode, monit will print debug information to the console. Use `ctrl+c` to stop monit in
diagnostic mode. To see all options for the program, use `monit -h`.

Copy `monitrc` in the build directory to *$HOME/.monitrc* or if you plan to run Monit as root, to */etc/monitc*. Use this file as a starting
point to write your own configuration file for Monit.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Please use `man monit` for an in-depth documentation of the program. More documentation can be found at [Monit's web-site](http://mmonit.com/monit/ "Documentation")
